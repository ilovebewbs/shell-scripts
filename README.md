### Useful shell scripts, kinda


So i found myself being into shell scripting and automating stuff a bit too much and thought i might share some "sharable" code so i'll be working on updating and polishing old scripts to share them here and needless to say, any contribution / help is beyond appreciated ❤️

**Current scripts**

`weather.sh`
![a gif](weather.gif)

 a tiny shell script to output your current weather with a cute rainbow colors text

**dependencies**
1. `curl` to make http calls
2. `jq` to easily parse JSON
3. `figlet` for a cool banner 
4. `lolcat` the amazing rainbow effect for the output text 

***HOW TO CONTRIBUTE***

1. Fork this repo
2. Make a new branch with the name of your shell script idea
3. Make a pull request
