# DISCORD EMBEDS FROM THE COMMAND LINE

*now send custom embeds in your discord server from the terminal*

### *Motivation behind it*

I personally love embeds in discord and find them very elegant so i thought let's automate this using a bash script

---

### ***current supported options***



`embed title`

`embed url`

`embed color`

`embed author name`

`embed author url`

`embed description`

`embed image link`

`embed username`

`avatar url`

---

**Example of how an embed looks using all options**

*some of the options are yet to be implemented so PRs are appreciated*


***To get a webhook***

Go to server settings > integrations > webhooks > create


*In case of using the script you ***MAY NOT*** change the footer text*
